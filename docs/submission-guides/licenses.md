# License
Users have the option to provide a license for their privately submitted data. However, the license is mandatory for making the data public. In [step-3 of the submission](/docs/submission-guides/submission/upload#complete---step-3), the user can see that the license field in the project is marked with red as it is required for publishing. By clicking `Edit`, they can provide one. Alternatively, after submission, the user can provide a license to the project from [View details](/docs/submission-guides/data-model/project#view-details) or [Edit button](/docs/submission-guides/data-model/project#edit-button) found next to the license field. 

Licensing propagates from parent objects to their children, meaning that licensing a project will reflect in its studies and datasets. However, the user can selectively give the studies different licenses, which propagate again to the datasets. At the dataset level, the user cannot provide licenses, which means that the dataset will always inherit its parent study license. Licensing a study can be done from the [View details](/docs/submission-guides/data-model/study#view-details) or [Edit button](/docs/submission-guides/data-model/study#edit-button) found next to the license field in the `About` tab of the [study view](/docs/submission-guides/data-model/study#study-view). The user can edit the licenses as long as the project is private.
