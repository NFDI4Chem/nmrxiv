### Did you find a bug?

* **Do not open up a GitHub discussion issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in nmrXiv**, and instead contact us here: <i>info.nmrxiv@uni-jena.de</i> (This email is not ready yet).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [nmrXiv issues](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/nmrxiv/issues).
    When searching change the filter box to both open and closed issues like this:
    ```bash
    is:issue is open
    ```
    to
    ```bash
    is:issue <my search word>
    ```
    e.g.
    ```bash
    is: issue theme
    ```

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new issue](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/nmrxiv/issues/new/choose) under the approriate category. Be sure to include a <b>Title</b> and clear <b>Description</b>, with as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
  
### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**
Please read the [Development workflow](https://docs.nmrxiv.org/docs/developer-guides/development-workflow) guide to learn more about coding conventions, opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Do not open an issue on GitHub or suggest your change in the nmrXiv mailing list before you start coding.

### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use nmrXiv in the nmrXiv mailing list.

Thanks!
