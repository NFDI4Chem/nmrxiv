* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [nmrXiv issues](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/nmrxiv/issues).
    When searching change the filter box to both open and closed issues like below:
    ```bash

    to
    ```bash

    e.g.
    ```bash
    is: issue theme
    ```

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new issue](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/nmrxiv/issues/new/choose) under the approriate category. Be sure to include a <b>Title</b> and clear <b>Description</b>, with as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
