## Support by Ontologies
While searching in NMR-related ontologies, finding terms about the temperature through an NMR assay wasn't possible. When saying "Temperature" here, we mean the temperature at which the NMR spectroscopy was conducted.  Unit-wise, one can easily use [ontology-driven units](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/uo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FUO_0000005&viewMode=All&siblings=false).

## Results
The temperature was easy to obtain in all the three repositories that provide it. However, the inconsistency encountered in the values and units made it time-consuming to harmonize the data.  In the end, having units coming (or possibly to be mapped) from ontologies made most of the data clear and machine-readable. The temperature provided in Celsius was converted to Kelvin, and with visualization, one can see that most of the assays were held around room temperature.

Still, some of the values were reported wrongly in Kelvin, as values like 0 and 37 can be seen in the graph showing the number of studies for each temperature (with a logarithmic scale).
