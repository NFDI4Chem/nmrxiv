## Support by Ontologies
The concept of [NMR solvent](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/nmrcv/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2FnmrML.org%2FnmrCV%23NMR%3A1000330) already exists in [nmr CV](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/nmrcv), unfortunately, without a definition. The same happens with [NMR buffer](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/nmrcv/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2FnmrML.org%2FnmrCV%23NMR%3A1000331). Despite that, the values for [solvents, buffers,](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/chebi) and their [concentrations units](https://terminology.nfdi4chem.de/ts/ontologies/uo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FUO_0000051&viewMode=All&siblings=false) can be ideally provided with ontology terms.

## Results
The solvent was possible to obtain in most studies and repositories, but it was rarely machine-readable, with a high level of inconsistencies. The following graph can give a rough estimate of popular solvents. However, it is far from accurate when it comes to exact numbers, as one solvent can be mentioned tens of times with different expressions.

<figcaption>A rough estimate of the percentages of all studies in the four repositories based on the NMR solvent (only solvent used in more than 50 studies are shown)</figcaption>

Here you can find the whole view of the four repositories with a logarithmic scale where you can easily notice how some solvents get repeated with different expressions.
